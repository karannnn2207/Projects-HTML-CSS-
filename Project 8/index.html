                    JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. 
                </p>
                 
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.

                    <li>Imperative language – In this type of language we are mostly concerned about how it is to be done. It simply controls the flow of computation. The procedural programming approach, object, oriented approach comes under this as async awai</li>
                    <li>Declarative programming – In this type of language we are concerned about how it is to be done, basically here logical computation requires. Her main goal is to describe the desired result without direct dictation on how to get it as the arrow function does.</li>

            <article>
              <p>
                JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
                does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
                and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
                renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
                provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
                any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
                objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
              </p>
              <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
                to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

            <h2>Hello World</h2>
            <article>
              To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
              your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
              <code
                >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");
              </code>
    
              Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
              browser!

          <section id="variables">
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <article>
              <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
                The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
                rules.
              </p>
              <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
                Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
                "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
                (lowercase).
              </p>
              <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
                identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
                characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
